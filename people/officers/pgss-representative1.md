Hi everyone!!!! My name is Angela (she/her), and I'm one of the PGSS
Representatives! I am a first year Masterâ€™s student in high energy particle
physics who reeeally loves physics (crazy, I know). My role is to represent
physics graduate students by voting and advocating on their behalf at PGSS
council meetings. We also ensure MGAPS stays well informed about any current
issues or initiatives related to PGSS. If you have any questions related to my
role, MGAPS, or PGSS, or just want to chat, feel free to send me an email!

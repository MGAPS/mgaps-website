Hi, I’m Samin, one of your representatives in the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS). My role is to represent the Physics graduate students by voting on their behalf at the PGSS Council meetings. I also ensure that MGAPS stays updated on important issues and initiatives. If you have any concerns or topics you’d like me to raise at the PGSS Council, feel free to reach out via email.

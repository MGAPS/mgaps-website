Hi! I am the Medical Physics liaison. Have you ever wondered what options are
available to you after completing your degree? If you’re interested in
exploring career paths in medical physics or have questions about the field,
please feel free to reach out to me. I attend MGAPS meetings, but the Medical
Physics Unit is located off campus, at the Glen (https://muhc.ca/glen-site) and
the Jewish General Hospital (https://www.jgh.ca/), so I’m not always on site.
That said, I’m always reachable by email. I’m a third-year PhD student working
on computer vision methods for cancer detection and survival analysis. Outside
of research, I enjoy playing chess, reading, and I’m currently working on
building a solid sleep routine. Here is my website:

Hi there, I'm Valentina! As the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer,
I work to make McGill Physics’ graduate experience more open and welcoming for
those who have been traditionally excluded from physics. I serve as a central
contact for any issues or concerns related to EDI, and I help organize
initiatives that celebrate and promote the wonderful diversity of backgrounds
we have in our department. I’m also a member of the departmental EDI committee,
where I represent MGAPS members and advise on social programming that aims to
include everyone. Moreover, I’m part of the Physics Outreach Committee, where I
love organizing events that bring science to a broader audience and make
physics more accessible and engaging for the public. Outside of physics, I love
spending time outdoors —  whether it’s running, skiing, or hiking. I’m also a
big music fan and enjoy reading whenever I can.

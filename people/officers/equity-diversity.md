Hi there! I'm Lily, a second year master's student in experimental low-temperature atomic force microscopy in Peter Grutter's research group. As Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer I work to make McGill Physics’ grad experience more open for those who are traditionally excluded from physics, which is especially important to me as a person with intersectional identities. I am a central contact for issues or concerns people may have with EDI-related matters, and I facilitate events that help promote the wonderful diversity of backgrounds we have here in the physics department! I'm also a member of the departmental EDI committee, where I represent MGAPS members and advise on social programming that doesn’t just cater to the mainstream or privileged groups. When I'm not researching or advising, I love hiking, playing tabletop roleplaying games, learning some new arts & crafts, reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and playing video games. I also ride motorcycles, own a sword, and dream of being New Zealand's first ever astronaut someday :) Feel free to reach out if you ever have any questions about EDI at McGill!

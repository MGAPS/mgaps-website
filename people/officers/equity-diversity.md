As Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer I work to make McGill Physics' grad experience more open for those who are traditionally excluded from physics. I run workshops to educate folks on issues of equity and inclusion, and promote diversity by offering more accessible amentities in the department like bathrooms, workspaces, and advise on social programming that doesn't just cater to the mainstream or privileged groups.

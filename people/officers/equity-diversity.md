Hi there! I'm Valentina. As Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer I
work to make McGill Physics’ grad experience more open for those who are
traditionally excluded from physics. I am a central contact for issues or
concerns people may have with EDI-related matters, and I facilitate events that
help promote the wonderful diversity of backgrounds we have here in the physics
department! I'm also a member of the departmental EDI committee, where I
represent MGAPS members and advise on social programming that doesn’t just
cater to the mainstream or privileged groups.

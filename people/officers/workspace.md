My job is to improve the physical work environment for graduate students in the department. Aside from currently implementing a renoâ€™d graduate lounge, I serve on the department safety committee(s), can assist in procuring office furniture, and improve other public work spaces like the elevator lounges. Ask me how I can help better your workspace!

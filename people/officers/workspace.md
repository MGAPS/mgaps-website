I'm Sarah (she/they), a second year masters student and your Workspace, Safety, and Accessibility Officer this year! I am tasked with ensuring the safety and quality of the environment of all grad students, and advocating for increased accessibility in Rutherford and all other relevant spaces on campus. I am the liaison between the grad students and the Physics EDI and Building Committees. Please reach out if you have a concern you'd like me to address!

Well hello again.... While my name, pronouns and field of study are the same,
Angela (she/her), my role has changed! This year, I have two roles, including
Workspace Officer.  In this role, I ensure the quality, safety, and
accessibility of physics graduate student environments, and I also serve on the
Physics EDI and Building Committees. If you have any suggestions, concerns, or
ideas related to our building, please let me know!

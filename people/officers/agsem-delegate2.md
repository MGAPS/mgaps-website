Are you employed at McGill? If you're a graduate student in the physics department, there's a very good chance you are. As your AGSEM representative, I ensure that your rights as an employee are respected. I also dedicate my free time to advocating for fair pay and making sure your voice is heard. If you have any employment-related issues, please don’t hesitate to contact me! In addition to being your AGSEM representative, I’m a first-year PhD student in Professor Andrew Cumming’s research group, where I run theoretical numerical simulations of neutron star winds using Athena++. I also have an interest in cosmology, history, foreign affairs and economics; all interesting facts are welcome with me. When I’m not working or advocating, you can usually find me rock climbing, DJing, listening to music, or catching up on sleep.

I am responsible for advocating for the wellbeing of our students, by promoting discussion spaces and supporting the creation of a more friendly and welcoming work environment. It is also my job to connect students with health resources inside and outside McGill. Apart from that, I can organize events, trainings, workshops or anything else youâ€™re interested in! I am also available for a talk over tea/coffee, active listening guaranteed :)

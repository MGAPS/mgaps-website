I am responsible for advocating for the wellbeing of our students, by promoting discussion spaces and supporting the creation of a more friendly and welcoming work environment. It is also my job to connect students with health resources inside and outside McGill. Apart from that, I can organize events, trainings, workshops or anything else youâ€™re interested in! I am also available for a talk over tea/coffee, active listening guaranteed :) Here's a list of resources if you need: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/115S6q4jsqyC-5e_OfD6eOt_IFr6Dg-FSW8OBUXgLrbU/edit#gid=1047443943

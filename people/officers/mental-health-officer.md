Hey everyone! I'm your new Mental Health officer for the semester, and it's my
job to help you stay sane during your graduate studies at McGill. I can help
connect you with the mental health resources that are available at McGill and
in Montreal, and hopefully give you some additional opportunities to destress
with some casual events throughout the year. Right now we're planning on having
weekly "destress" lunches where you can come draw, colour, journal, and/or
chat, and weekly w(h)ine nights where you can complain about your PI and
whatever else has been bothering you the past week (with the aid of alcohol if
you partake)! We'll also be doing some dog therapy events peppered throughout
the semester (for the worries that only a puppy can fix). Aside from these
please feel free to contact me by email for more personal requests (or just
grab me if you find me in the hallways/in my office). Life and grad school can
be very stressful, and I would be more than happy to provide support where I
can.

Outside of my duties as your mental health officer and as a grad student (I'm
in my 2nd year of my Master's with Peter Grutter), I like watching movies,
listening to music, and I've been getting back into reading. Recently I've been
working through Masaki Kobayashi's filmography and getting into Steinbeck, and
I'm always happy to chat about anything interesting you've been
reading/watching/listening to! Come trade your letterboxd/last.fm/goodreads
with me if you want, I love being nosy :)!

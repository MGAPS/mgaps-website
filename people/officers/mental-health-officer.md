Hi! I'm Christian, your mental health officer. It is my role to connect you with mental health resources: both on and off campus. If you are feeling overwhelmed by graduate studies, or just the weight of being human, and are unsure where to turn, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always available to listen and try to point you in the direction of help.  Part of my responsibility is to promote a welcoming environment where students can experience their feelings without judgement. I also organize wellbeing events throughout the year, so keep an eye on your email! See https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/resources/grads.html for a non-comprehensive list of resources.

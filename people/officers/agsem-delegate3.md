Hi! Iâ€™m Noah. I'm a second-year master's student in condensed matter theory, and I'm one of the physics department delegates to the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM). This means I'm one of your first points of contact with our TA union should you ever have any questions or concerns about your rights as an employee. I also help represent our department (along with my fellow delegates) at AGSEM meetings and try to keep our department informed on what's going on in the union.

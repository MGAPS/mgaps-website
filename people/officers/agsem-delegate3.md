I am one of your three delegates in McGill's TA union, the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM). My role is to inform and inspect: inform you about your rights as a teaching assistant, and monitor the observance of the TA collective convention in the physics department. I also represent you at monthly delegates' councils and I attend quarterly general assemblies. If you have any question or complaint related to your working conditions as a TA, do not hesitate to contact me.

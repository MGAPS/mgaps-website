Hi! I'm Eric, a Master's student in experimental condensed matter physics. I am
one of three physics department AGSEM delegates. If you are employedÂ by McGill,
such as in a T.A. or invigilator position, then you are automatically a member
of the oldest teaching assistant union in Quebec, AGSEM! I will advocate for
and support your rights as an employee of McGill. Come to our AGSEM physics
office hour, or reach out to us if you ever have any problems related to your
employment at McGill, big or small.

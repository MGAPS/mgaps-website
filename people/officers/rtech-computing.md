Hi, I'm Simon and I'm the RTech and Computing Officer! This officer acts as a
resource for students seeking or initiating computational skill development
opportunities (such as workshops, seminars, lecture series, etc...) in the
department. I am also responsible for maintaining the MGAPS website. If your
computer is ever acting up, let me know and I may be able to help you. I have
a decent programming background, being skilled in a few languages (Python, Java,
C, C++, OCaml, HTML, CSS, LabVIEW, Lua and even a little bit of assembly!) and
am fairly comfortable jumping between operating systems (including linux!).

Aside from this technical stuff, I'm a huge music nerd. I listen to everything.
I really mean it. [Check out my lastfm if you're curious to see what I
mean](https://www.last.fm/user/bal00balla).

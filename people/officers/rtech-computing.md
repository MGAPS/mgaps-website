I run interactive events to improve gradsâ€™ computer-related skills. In the Fall semester, these will be Codetober, a workshop series on introductory programming topics every Tuesday of October, and the 4th edition of the Physics Hackathon Nov. 2-3. Check out [https://www.facebook.com/RTechMcGill](https://www.facebook.com/RTechMcGill) and [www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon](www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon). I hope to see you there!

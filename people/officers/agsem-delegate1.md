Hi! I'm one of your delegates to the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), which is your teaching assistant (TA) union. My job is to make sure you know your rights as a TA and make sure they're being respected throughout the department. I attend AGSEM meetings to keep you up to date.

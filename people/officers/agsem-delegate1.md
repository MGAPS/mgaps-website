Hi! I’m one of your delegates to the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM), which is your teaching assistant (TA) union. My job is to make sure you know your rights as a TA and make sure they’re being respected throughout the department. I also attend AGSEM meetings and events to keep you up to date. If you ever have any TA related issues/concerns please reach out to me and I can help navigate available resources and advocate for your rights!

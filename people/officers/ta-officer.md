Hello! I'm a first year Master's student in experimental condensed matter physics, and the current TA officer for MGAPS. My role involves collecting and sharing logistical and pedagogical resources for TA's. If you have any good teaching resources, or any recommendations for information to include in our TA wiki (coming soon) please reach out to me!

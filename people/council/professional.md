Many physics students leave academia after graduation, but start their job search too late and use poor strategies relying solely on their personal network. My job is to coordinate action in providing awareness of earlier career planning and professional development while still in grad school.

* fostering network of McGill Physics Alumni
* facilitating contacts with professional clubs and associations
* inviting experts to learn about jobs that require skills physicists develop pursuing our degrees

Keep your eye out for panel discussions, workshops, and networking events! Also, let me know if there are skills you need help developing or resources youâ€™d like for job searching!

Hi! I am Naman. As the professional development officer, my job is to coordinate action in providing awareness of earlier career planning and professional development while still in grad school. I plan to do this by fostering network of McGill Physics Alumni, facilitating contacts with professional clubs and associations, and inviting experts to learn about jobs that require skills physicists develop pursuing our degrees. Keep your eye out for panel discussions, workshops, and networking events, and let me know if there are skills you need help developing or resources youâ€™d like for job searching!

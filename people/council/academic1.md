My role is to create a positive and pleasant academic experience for MGAPS members. You are welcome to approach me with any sort of academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) issue, and I will guide you by either acting as a liaison or directing you to the appropriate resources. I am also in charge of the MGAPS colloquia which happens once per year, the coffee & cookies gatherings with colloquium speakers which happened every Friday at 2.30 PM, and the Undergrad Mentorship Program, which I run in collaboration with the MSPS VP Academic in order to foster interaction between undergraduate and graduate students/postdocs. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions concerning academic matters in the department.

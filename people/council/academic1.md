Hi! I’m Katya, a first-year PhD student in experimental condensed matter. As VP
Academic, my goal is to foster a pleasant and enriching environment for
students, and to facilitate communication and collaboration between MGAPS and
MSPS, the undergraduate student society. I oversee the Coffee & Cookies
gatherings with colloquium speakers, held weekly on Fridays at 2:35PM, and
manage the Undergrad Mentorship Program. Outside of research, I enjoy creative
writing, reading (and running a book club!), playing frisbee, and exploring
Montréal cafés to find the perfect cappuccino. Please don’t hesitate to contact
me with any academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) concerns - I am here
to support you and to direct you to appropriate resources.

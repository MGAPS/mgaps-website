Hi! I’m Katya, a condensed matter experimentalist. As VP Academic,
I support students’ academic inquiries and serve as a point person 
for visiting lecturers. I also manage the Undergrad Mentorship 
Program between MGAPS and MSPS. Join me at the weekly Cookies & Convo 
chats to meet visiting academics and industry scientists 
(Fridays at 2:30PM in RP 322)!

Outside of research, I enjoy creative writing, reading 
(and currently running several book clubs!), playing frisbee, and 
trying out as many Montréal cafés as I can. You can contact me with 
any academic concerns (e.g., supervisory or course-related). I am here 
to support you and to direct you to appropriate resources.

As VP Academic, I do my best to contribute to a positive academic experience for MGAPS members. You can come to me with any sort of academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) problem, and I’ll help out by either acting as a liaison or directing you to the appropriate resources. I’m also responsible for the MGAPS colloquia (one per year), the coffee & cookies gatherings with colloquium speakers (every Friday at 3PM), and the Undergrad Mentorship Program, which I run in collaboration with the MSPS VP Academic in order to foster interaction between undergrads and grad students/postdocs. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions concerning academic matters in the department.

The president is the spokesperson and main organizer of MGAPS. They facilitate contact with other groups both within and outside McGill and delegate responsibility to the various other executive board members. The president is one of the most visible members of the physics community, and has the opportunity to interact with most facets of the department. If you ever have an idea of how MGAPS or the department in general can better serve you or the graduate community as a whole, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me, and I hope to see you at future events and meetings!

The president is the main organizer and spokesperson of MGAPS in general. It is the job of the president to initiate, coordinate and facilitate MGAPS initiatives that improve the graduate experience by working together with the executive and officers, the department, and other groups on campus (PGSS, MSPS). This position boasts the most visibility and overall responsibility but also requires attention to smaller tasks (such as assisting students on individual issues, organizing cookies/coffee with visiting speakers, etc...). By undertaking this job you get valuable experience working with the department at all levels and having the opportunity to make a difference for your fellow students.

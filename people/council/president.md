Hi there! My name is Catherine and I am both a PhD candidate in experimental condensed matter physics and MGAPS President of our 2024-2025 council. As president, my main task is to be the primary spokesperson for all physics graduate students. I am mandated to advocate for our community, which means overseeing our MGAPS council, ensuring communication and transparency between the students and the department, listening to any and all concerns of our community, coordinating with other groups within and outside McGill, and overall making sure that our needs as a whole are met. MGAPS works towards continuously bettering our community, so if there is an issue that we arenâ€™t aware of or needs that are not being met, do not hesitate to contact any council members (or shoot me an email!). We are here for YOU.

Hi there! My name is Gui and I am both a Master's student in experimental
condensed matter physics and MGAPS President of our 2025-2026 council. As
president, my main task is to be the primary spokesperson for all physics
graduate students. I am mandated to advocate for our community, which means
overseeing our MGAPS council, ensuring communication and transparency between
the students and the department, listening to any and all concerns of our
community, coordinating with other groups within and outside McGill, and
overall making sure that our needs as a whole are met. MGAPS works towards
continuously bettering our community, so if there is an issue that we arenâ€™t
aware of or needs that are not being met, do not hesitate to contact any
council members (or shoot me an email!). We are here for YOU.

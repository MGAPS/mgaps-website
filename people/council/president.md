Hi I'm Gui! I'm a master's student in condensed matter physics and your MGAPS
president for the 2025-2026 council! MGAPS works to continuously improve our
community, so if there is an issue we aren't aware of or needs that aren't
being met, do not hesitate to contact any council member (or shoot me an
email!). We are here for you! Yes, YOU. My responsibility is to be the primary
spokesperson for all physics graduate students. As president, I am mandated to
advocate for our community, which means overseeing our MGAPS council, ensuring
communication and transparency between our students and the department,
coordinating with other groups within and outside McGill, and making sure that
our needs as a whole are met. We have big plans this year, so check out our
calendar and stay tuned for our newsletters to hear about upcoming events!

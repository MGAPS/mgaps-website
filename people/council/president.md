Hi! As president of MGAPS, I act as the primary spokesperson and advocate for all graduate students. This includes coordinating the MGAPS executive, ensuring constant communication with the department, listening to and voicing the concerns of graduate students, and facilitating contact with other groups within and outside McGill. I am also involved in (ongoing) negotiations around the graduate student stipend. We're constantly looking for ways to better serve grad students, but we can't do so without knowing what issues you're facing or where your needs aren't being met. Please don't hesitate to email me or contact me on the grad students' slack!

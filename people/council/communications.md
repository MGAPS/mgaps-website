The VP communications is in charge of the MGAPS website, advertising MGAPS events, organizing social media, creating informative posters and communicating with you all in general. If I'm doing my job right, you'll get regular emails from me. Follow MGAPS on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialMGAPS/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialMGAPS) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/officialmgaps/) to stay up to date with what we are doing! I also take on secretarial duties such as taking minutes and attendance at the GAs.

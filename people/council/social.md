Hi! My name is Nick and I'm a 3rd year PhD doing astrophysics. As your VP Social, my job is to organize the social events you want to see! Want a painting night? To play video games in our grad lounge (Rutherford 322)? To hang out at Thomson House? Reach out to me with your ideas and let's make it happen. I also previously served as president of MGAPS in 2022-2023 and as a delegate for your TA union, AGSEM.

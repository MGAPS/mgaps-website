__Why social events are important__: When pursuing an advanced degree occasions to meet people from other fields are scarce, but it is valuable to make connections between fields and between theory and experiment. It's also important to have fun!

__Duties/Activities__: You decide! Past activities have included a Hockey Night In Physics (organize a gathering in a bar after physics league Hockey games), the annual Cocktail party (biggest event, usually organized at Thompson house), the Winter retreat (spend a weekend at the McGill outdoor club house), among others. My job is also to help motivate people organizing activities within the department by providing them with a financial support and guidance, don't be afraid to suggest an activity you think would be successful!

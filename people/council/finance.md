Hello! I’m Aditya, a 1st year master’s student working in condensed matter
physics. I’m super excited to serve on the MGAPS council this year as the VP
Finance. For my role, I will be taking inspiration from Mr. Monopoly, Michael
J. Burry (from the Big Short), and Leo Rizk. They made some pretty good
financial decisions. Come say hi if you see me around Rutherford or if you have
some ideas/suggestions for MGAPS!

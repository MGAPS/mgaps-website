Hello grads and postdocs!
My name’s Leo and I’m a first-year MSc student (in astroparticle physics with Ken Ragan).
I’m new to McGill but I’m not new to the city! Ask me about the best places to visit in Montreal, or where to find the most delicious pizza or drinks! :eyes:
When I’m not busy astrophysicsing, I’m probably out on my bike or playing Nintendo.
This year, I am the VP Finance for MGAPS. I am also the new grad student representative on the TSI Board of Directors. I make genuine efforts to fill my duties with care and commitment, and I hope to earn your trust and friendship over the coming months. If there’s anything I can help with, please let me know. You can find me in my office at ERP 303 or you can email me at leandro.rizk@mail.mcgill.ca.
Take care!
Leo Rizk (he/him)

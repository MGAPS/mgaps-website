Hello physics grads and postdocs! My name’s Leo and I’m a second-year MSc student working in astroparticle physics. I’m from Montreal and I love this city! Ask me about the best places to visit or where to find the most delicious pizza or drinks! When I’m not busy astrophysicsing, I’m probably out on my bike or playing Nintendo. This is my second year as VP Finance for MGAPS. My role is to manage the budget, track all our transactions, and keep MGAPS financially sober. MGAPS is funded by you (its members) and I make sure that these funds are used judiciously to benefit you. If there’s anything I can help with, please let me know.

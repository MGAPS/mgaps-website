As the VP Academic, it is my job to contribute to a positive academic experience for MGAPS members. Also, I am in charge of the [Mentorship program](/academic/mentorship.html). I can act as a liaison for students who are having any kind of academic (courses and supervision) problems, and point them to the resources available to deal with those problems. Relevant academic information can be found [here](/program/program.html). Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions regarding the academic matters at the department, or if you are currently having any problems regarding courses or supervision.

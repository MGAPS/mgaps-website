### Fridges

MGAPS and the department of Physics replaced the fridges on the 2nd and 3rd floor in 2013.

These fridges are a shared resource that all users must respect.

1. On Friday every two weeks, one of the fridges will be emptied. Anything left behind can be thrown out at the discretion of the person performing the clean that week. To ensure your items are not thrown out, you may wish to move them to the other fridge.
2. Moldy, rotten items may be thrown out by any one, at any time, no questions asked.
3. If you see your food has left behind a spill or other residue in the fridge, please wipe it down.
4. Users of the fridges are encouraged to sign up for the cleaning rotation.

The McGill Physics Department has a variety of intramural sports teams and pick-up sports and encourages students to get involved!

MGAPS encourages students to participate in one of the existing teams and to create other sports teams. In fact, MGAPS subsidize the registration to sports team, up to $5 per semester per student (per sport).

__To get involved__:

1. Choose the sport you want to play from the list below (or create your own team from the list at the bottom of the page).
2. Email the captain to express your interest.
3. Play intramural sports with physics friends!

## Existing teams

### Basketball

This team was formed in the fall semester 2013 and started out as a D-league team in the coed-league! Since then, it has moved on to greater things and switched to C-league play in the winter semester of 2015. If you are interested in being part of that team, contact the team captain. If you want to form a new team and need help (like getting your team on this website), contact the physics sports officer, Jan Borchmann at bjan@physics.mcgill.ca.

__Current Teams__:
Team Captain: __Yony Bresler__ (email: [yony.bresler@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:yony.bresler@mail.mcgill.ca))

### Ice Hockey

This year, there are 4 intramural physics ice hockey teams. The D-league is for beginners with little to no skill, while the C-league is a bit more competitive for experienced players. The four teams get together for some practice at the beginning or end of each semester. If you want to form a new team and need help (like getting your team on this website), contact the physics sports officer, Matthew Rigby at rigbym@physics.mcgill.ca.

Every year, the D-league teams play one or two games against each other. It is a great occasion to get together and have fun on the ice, and at the Bar des Pins after the game.

#### The Icy Photons  -  B-league 

Team captain: __Robert Maglieri__ (email: [robert.maglieri@gmail.com](mailto:robert.maglieri@gmail.com))

#### The EigenSkates  -  C-league 

Team captain: __Eric Whiteway__ (email: [whiteway@physics.mcgill.ca](mailto:whiteway@physics.mcgill.ca))

#### The Absolute Zeros  -  D-league

Team captain: __Ann-Lauriene Haag__ (email: [haagal@physics.mcgill.ca](mailto:haagal@physics.mcgill.ca))           

#### Cold Fusion  -  D-league

Team captain: __Aaron Farrell__ (email: [farrella@physics.mcgill.ca](mailto:farrella@physics.mcgill.ca))

### Pick-up Sports

Individuals from the physics department often organize informal pick-up sports, usually in the reservoir on Docteur Penfield. To get involved:

1. Email the person who organizes pick-up sports and ask to be put on the mailing list.
2. Receive emails from this person about pick-up.
3. Play pick-up sports!

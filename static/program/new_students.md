Welcome!

Here’s links on how to get settled into the McGill Physics Department as a new graduate student:

* Review and complete the on arrival items listed here: [http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/grads/arrival.html](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/grads/arrival.html)
* Check out the seminars and journal clubs going on in the department. Remember these are open to all students!
    * [Physics](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/seminars/)
    * [McGill Space Institute](https://msi.mcgill.ca/index.php?page=discussion-groups)
* Review the [McGill finances page](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/grads/finance.html) and enter your banking info on **Minerva → Employee Menu → Direct Deposit Bank Account**. 
    * Make sure to fill up both the “payroll related” and “student related” bank info, even if the information is the same. This is very important for all since the information will be used for direct deposit of your pay-check, for scholarships and for travel-expenses reimbursement.

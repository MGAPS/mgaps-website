Graduate students pay comes from a combination of funding.

### Departmental funding

#### Non-scholarship students

Graduate students admitted into the Physics Department are guaranteed financial support of $21,400 per annum, in addition to tuition fee assistance as outlined in the Fees section. This amount is subject to review every year, and is made up of a $16,700 research assistantship (RA) and $4,700 teaching assistantship (TA).

#### Scholarship students

Holders of a major scholarship such as NSERC and FQRNT will receive an RA top-up of $6,500, in addition to $4,700 TA and tuition fee assistance as outlined above. Concurrent Tomlinson Fellowship recipients are not entitled to the RA top-up.
Holders of McGill internal fellowships and other small scholarships (see below) will receive RA support to top-up the scholarship to a total of $21,400 plus 20% of the value of the scholarship.
In other words, winners of other smaller scholarships should not expect to receive the entire amount. 80% of the scholarship is absorbed by any existing RAship, and the student receives a pay increase of 20% the value of the scholarship. So, if a student wins a $5000 scholarship, his/her net pay increases by $1000 for the year.

#### Major Scholarships: NSERC, FQRNT and Tomlinson
Canadian citizens and permanent residents are encouraged to apply for NSERC scholarships and those who are residents of Québec should also compete for FQRNT scholarships. Major Scholarship holders do NOT receive the $16,700 baseline RAship. Instead, they receive

1. Scholarship funding (typically evenly distributed throughout the year)
2. TAship (~$4000 during the fall and winter semesters)
3. Top-up RAship ($6500 typically during the summer, only for NSERC and FQRNT)

Holders of a major scholarship such as NSERC and FQRNT will receive an RA top-up of $6,500, in addition to $4,000 TA and tuition fee assistance as outlined above. Concurrent Tomlinson Fellowship recipients are not entitled to the RA top-up.

The annual award amounts are currently:

__NSERC__

* MSc $17,300 (PGS M) / $17,500 (CGS M)
* PhD $21,000 (PGS D) / $35,000 (CGS D)

__FQRNT__

* MSc $15,000
* PhD $20,000

#### Recruitment fellowships

The Offices of the Provost and Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies are providing recruitment support to all new MSc and PhD students at McGill. Last year, all new students received one-time Provost's Graduate Fellowships in the amount of:

* $5,000 for each new PhD student who will be registered for at least 1 semester in 2009/2010. 
* $1,500 for each new Research Master’s student who will be registered for at least 1 semester in 2009/2010

#### New Students Accelerator

New students who hold NSERC or FQRNT scholarships also receive a one-time Trottier ‘Accelerator’ Fellowship in the amount of $5,000.

#### Physics Department Internal Fellowship competition

For the last few years, the physics department had some money to distribute as fellowships. Those are not available to major scholarships holder ($10,000 and above). For the year 2010-2011, the available scholarships ranged from $2500 (Principal's Graduate Fellowships) and $25,000 (Schulich Graduate Fellowships and Richard Tomlison Fellowship). Students who will be in their PhD 6 or above or MSc 3 or above in September are not eligible to apply (Please note that the PhD-years start with PhD 2 -- check your Minerva)

Also, the PBEEE scholarship from the FQRNT is exclusively for international students.

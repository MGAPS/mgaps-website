#### Code-tober 2019

This year our RTech Officer will be organising multiple programming workshops! These will be introductory and will have a spin on physics so that graduate students can learn useful skills for their research! They are also completely accessible to anyone with an interest in coding and McGill Physics Hackathon participants are strongly encouraged to attend!

[Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/438868023503745/) for the Facebook event!

While you're here, check out the [McGill Physics Hackathon 2019](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/)!

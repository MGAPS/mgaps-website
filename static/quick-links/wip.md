The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) committee is a group of faculty members, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students whose role is to provide leadership and resources to the department in promoting equitable and inclusive environment. We strive for a department in which every member feels a sense of belonging and can achieve their full potential as researchers, teachers, and community members.

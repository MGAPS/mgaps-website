MGAPS is a non-profit organization with revenues coming from membership fees from students in physics and fund raising events. The fees are administered by the PGSS Grad Student Life fund. Each grad student pays $10 per semester through their fees to PGSS, MGAPS can then recall the funds during the year on an as needed basis.

<p>The T-Pulse group (Tomlinson Project in University-Level Science Education) is committed to improving science teaching and learning at McGill. T-Pulse organizes free graduate teaching workshops for TAs in science: <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/workshop">https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/workshop</a>. These workshops represent a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with efficient teaching techniques and to address your concerns, especially as a new TA.</p>

<p>Supporting Active Learning &amp; Technological Innovation in Science Education (SALTISE) is a community of practice that brings together instructors and professional development staff from English and French educational institutions within the greater Montreal area, as well as other regions of Quebec. The key goals of SALTISE are based on the ideas of pedagogical change involving innovations in instruction and leveraging the use of educational technology to promote learning.</p>
<p>Goals of SALTISE:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote the development of a community of practice among science instructors at both levels of education.</li>
<li>To foster collaborations that will support the development, dissemination and sharing of innovative science pedagogies including the effective uses of technology and new learning environments.</li>
<li>To promote sustainability of the human, pedagogical and technological resources, as well as the institutional infrastructure created through these collaborations, by establishing a Center with appropriate public presence (e.g., website).</li>
<li>To disseminate best practices in science education through a mentorship model that supports peer-to-peer mutual sharing within and between educational levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the initial grant SALTISE organized events and workshops that are of interest to the science education community.</p>
<p>If you are interested to take part to one of these events, please contact the Graduate Teaching and Learning Coordinator (<a href="mailto:gtlc@physics.mcgill.ca">gtlc@physics.mcgill.ca</a>) or visit <a href="http://www.saltise.ca/">SALTISE website</a>.</p>

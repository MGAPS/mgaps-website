            <p>Hi I’m Gui! I’m a master’s student in condensed matter physics and your MGAPS
president for the 2025-2026 council! MGAPS works to continuously improve our
community, so if there is an issue we aren’t aware of or needs that aren’t
being met, do not hesitate to contact any council member (or shoot me an
email!). We are here for you! Yes, YOU. My responsibility is to be the primary
spokesperson for all physics graduate students. As president, I am mandated to
advocate for our community, which means overseeing our MGAPS council, ensuring
communication and transparency between our students and the department,
coordinating with other groups within and outside McGill, and making sure that
our needs as a whole are met. We have big plans this year, so check out our
calendar and stay tuned for our newsletters to hear about upcoming events!</p>

            <p>Hi! I’m Katya, a first-year PhD student in experimental condensed matter. As VP
Academic, my goal is to foster a pleasant and enriching environment for
students, and to facilitate communication and collaboration between MGAPS and
MSPS, the undergraduate student society. I oversee the Coffee &amp; Cookies
gatherings with colloquium speakers, held weekly on Fridays at 2:35PM, and
manage the Undergrad Mentorship Program. Outside of research, I enjoy creative
writing, reading (and running a book club!), playing frisbee, and exploring
Montréal cafés to find the perfect cappuccino. Please don’t hesitate to contact
me with any academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) concerns - I am here
to support you and to direct you to appropriate resources.</p>

time to advocating for fair pay and making sure your voice is heard. If you
have any employment-related issues, please don’t hesitate to contact me! In
addition to being your AGSEM representative, I’m a first-year PhD student in
Professor Andrew Cumming’s research group, where I run theoretical numerical
simulations of neutron star winds using Athena++. I also have an interest in
cosmology, history, foreign affairs and economics; all interesting facts are
welcome with me. When I’m not working or advocating, you can usually find me
rock climbing, DJing, listening to music, or catching up on sleep.</p>

            <p>Hi there, I’m Valentina! As the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer,
I work to make McGill Physics’ graduate experience more open and welcoming for
those who have been traditionally excluded from physics. I serve as a central
contact for any issues or concerns related to EDI, and I help organize
initiatives that celebrate and promote the wonderful diversity of backgrounds
we have in our department. I’m also a member of the departmental EDI committee,
where I represent MGAPS members and advise on social programming that aims to
include everyone. Moreover, I’m part of the Physics Outreach Committee, where I
love organizing events that bring science to a broader audience and make
physics more accessible and engaging for the public. Outside of physics, I love
spending time outdoors — whether it’s running, skiing, or hiking. I’m also a
big music fan and enjoy reading whenever I can.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! I’m your new Mental Health officer for the semester, and it’s my
job to help you stay sane during your graduate studies at McGill. I can help
connect you with the mental health resources that are available at McGill and
in Montreal, and hopefully give you some additional opportunities to destress
with some casual events throughout the year. Right now we’re planning on having
weekly “destress” lunches where you can come draw, colour, journal, and/or
chat, and weekly w(h)ine nights where you can complain about your PI and
whatever else has been bothering you the past week (with the aid of alcohol if
you partake)! We’ll also be doing some dog therapy events peppered throughout
the semester (for the worries that only a puppy can fix). Aside from these
please feel free to contact me by email for more personal requests (or just
grab me if you find me in the hallways/in my office). Life and grad school can
be very stressful, and I would be more than happy to provide support where I
can.</p>
<p>Outside of my duties as your mental health officer and as a grad student (I’m
in my 2nd year of my Master’s with Peter Grutter), I like watching movies,
listening to music, and I’ve been getting back into reading. Recently I’ve been
working through Masaki Kobayashi’s filmography and getting into Steinbeck, and
I’m always happy to chat about anything interesting you’ve been
reading/watching/listening to! Come trade your letterboxd/last.fm/goodreads
with me if you want, I love being nosy :)!</p>

am fairly comfortable jumping between operating systems (including linux!).</p>

            <p>Well hello again…. While my name, pronouns and field of study are the same,
Angela (she/her), my role has changed! This year, I have two roles, including
Workspace Officer. In this role, I ensure the quality, safety, and
accessibility of physics graduate student environments, and I also serve on the
Physics EDI and Building Committees. If you have any suggestions, concerns, or
ideas related to our building, please let me know!</p>

            <p>Hi! As president of MGAPS, I act as the primary spokesperson and advocate for all graduate students. This includes coordinating the MGAPS executive, ensuring constant communication with the department, listening to and voicing the concerns of graduate students, and facilitating contact with other groups within and outside McGill. I am also involved in (ongoing) negotiations around the graduate student stipend. We’re constantly looking for ways to better serve grad students, but we can’t do so without knowing what issues you’re facing or where your needs aren’t being met. Please don’t hesitate to email me or contact me on the grad students’ slack!</p>

            <p>Hi! I am Aditya and your VP Academic. My role is to create a positive and pleasant academic experience for MGAPS members. You are welcome to approach me with any sort of academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) issue, and I will guide you by either acting as a liaison or directing you to the appropriate resources. I am also in charge of the MGAPS colloquia which happens once per year, the coffee &amp; cookies gatherings with colloquium speakers which happened every Friday at 2.30 PM, and the Undergrad Mentorship Program, which I run in collaboration with the MSPS VP Academic in order to foster interaction between undergraduate and graduate students/postdocs. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions concerning academic matters in the department.</p>

            <p>When pursuing an advanced degree occasions to meet people from other fields are scarce, but it is valuable to make connections between fields and between theory and experiment. It’s also important to have fun! Past activities have included a Hockey Night In Physics (organize a gathering in a bar after physics league Hockey games), the annual Cocktail party (biggest event, usually organized at Thompson house), the Winter retreat (spend a weekend at the McGill outdoor club house), among others. My job is also to help motivate people organizing activities within the department by providing them with a financial support and guidance, don’t be afraid to suggest an activity you think would be successful!</p>

I run workshops to educate folks on issues of equity and inclusion, and promote diversity by offering more accessible amentities in the department like bathrooms, workspaces, and advise on social programming that doesn’t just cater to the mainstream or privileged groups.</p>

            <p>I am responsible for advocating on the wellbeing of our students-by promoting discussion spaces and supporting the creation of a more friendly and welcoming work environment. It is also my job to connect students with health resources inside and outside McGill. Apart from that, I organize events, trainings, workshops or anything else that’s related to wellness that you’re interested in! Your happiness is extremely important in graduate school, and MGAPS wants to help. I am also available for a talk over tea/coffee, active listening guaranteed :) Here’s a list of resources if you need: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/115S6q4jsqyC-5e_OfD6eOt_IFr6Dg-FSW8OBUXgLrbU/edit#gid=1047443943</p>

            <p>Hi there! My name is Catherine and I am both a PhD candidate in experimental condensed matter physics and MGAPS President of our 2024-2025 council. As president, my main task is to be the primary spokesperson for all physics graduate students. I am mandated to advocate for our community, which means overseeing our MGAPS council, ensuring communication and transparency between the students and the department, listening to any and all concerns of our community, coordinating with other groups within and outside McGill, and overall making sure that our needs as a whole are met. MGAPS works towards continuously bettering our community, so if there is an issue that we aren’t aware of or needs that are not being met, do not hesitate to contact any council members (or shoot me an email!). We are here for YOU.</p>

            <p>Hi! I’m Katya, a first-year PhD student in experimental condensed matter. As VP Academic, my goal is to foster a pleasant and enriching environment for students, and to facilitate communication and collaboration between MGAPS and MSPS, the undergraduate student society. I oversee the Coffee &amp; Cookies gatherings with colloquium speakers, held weekly on Fridays at 2:35PM, and manage the Undergrad Mentorship Program. Outside of research, I enjoy creative writing, reading (and running a book club!), playing frisbee, and exploring Montréal cafés to find the perfect cappuccino. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any academic (i.e. supervisory or course-related) concerns - I am here to support you and to direct you to appropriate resources.</p>

Ask me about the best places to visit or where to find the most delicious pizza or drinks! When I’m not busy astrophysicsing, I’m probably out on my bike or playing Nintendo. This is my second year as VP Finance for MGAPS. My role is to manage the budget, track all our transactions, and keep MGAPS financially sober. MGAPS is funded by you (its members) and I make sure that these funds are used judiciously to benefit you. If there’s anything I can help with, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Are you employed at McGill? If you’re a graduate student in the physics department, there’s a very good chance you are. As your AGSEM representative, I ensure that your rights as an employee are respected. I also dedicate my free time to advocating for fair pay and making sure your voice is heard. If you have any employment-related issues, please don’t hesitate to contact me! In addition to being your AGSEM representative, I’m a first-year PhD student in Professor Andrew Cumming’s research group, where I run theoretical numerical simulations of neutron star winds using Athena++. I also have an interest in cosmology, history, foreign affairs and economics; all interesting facts are welcome with me. When I’m not working or advocating, you can usually find me rock climbing, DJing, listening to music, or catching up on sleep.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I’m Lily, a second year master’s student in experimental low-temperature atomic force microscopy in Peter Grutter’s research group. As Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer I work to make McGill Physics’ grad experience more open for those who are traditionally excluded from physics, which is especially important to me as a person with intersectional identities. I am a central contact for issues or concerns people may have with EDI-related matters, and I facilitate events that help promote the wonderful diversity of backgrounds we have here in the physics department! I’m also a member of the departmental EDI committee, where I represent MGAPS members and advise on social programming that doesn’t just cater to the mainstream or privileged groups. When I’m not researching or advising, I love hiking, playing tabletop roleplaying games, learning some new arts &amp; crafts, reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and playing video games. I also ride motorcycles, own a sword, and dream of being New Zealand’s first ever astronaut someday :) Feel free to reach out if you ever have any questions about EDI at McGill!</p>

If you are feeling overwhelmed by graduate studies, or just the weight of being human, and are unsure where to turn, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always available to listen and try to point you in the direction of help. Part of my responsibility is to promote a welcoming environment where students can experience their feelings without judgement. I also organize wellbeing events throughout the year, so keep an eye on your email! See https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/resources/grads.html for a non-comprehensive list of resources.</p>

            <p>Well hello again…. While my name, pronouns and field of study are the same,
Angela (she/her), my role has changed! This year, I have two roles, including
Workspace Officer. In this role, I ensure the quality, safety, and
accessibility of physics graduate student environments, and I also serve on the
Physics EDI and Building Committees. If you have any suggestions, concerns, or
ideas related to our building, please let me know!</p>

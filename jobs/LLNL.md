summary: carrying out experiments that use trapped-ion samples to precisely study the beta decay of 8Li, 8B, and other light nuclei to test fundamental symmetries in nuclear beta decay and to better understand the structure of exotic nuclei. These experiments will be performed at radioactive beam facilities such as ANL and TRIUMF and the data analysis will involve the development of detailed simulations and an in-depth characterization of the apparatus.

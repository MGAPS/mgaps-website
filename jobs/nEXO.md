summary: We work on TPC, Cryogenics, and Calibration activities for nEXO. In the lab, we characterize SiPM's and VUV-optics in LXe and develop calibration strategies using in-LXe photocathodes. nEXO simulations and EXO-200 analysis are also carried out at UMass. Partial involvement in other activities (e.g. DarkSide, Borexino) is possible.

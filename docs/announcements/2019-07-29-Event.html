<p>Summer 2019 has brought great challenges to certain minority communities amongst us. Quebec Bill 21, passed June 16th, bans wearing religious items while on the job as a public official (for example: a kippah, turban, hijab, or cross when working as, say, a teacher or police officer). We recognize not only the career and financial struggles this poses to physics students, staff, and faculty and our family and friends, but also the potential for deep emotional pain accompanying this message of exclusion from Quebec government.</p>
<p>As the MGAPS executive board, we want to offer some assistance to our affected members as well as highlight pre-existing avenues for support.</p>
<h5 id="internal-support" class="title is-5">Internal support:</h5>
<p>The MGAPS Equity and Diversity Officer, Talia Martz-Oberlander, is hosting two identical dialogues for those affected by Bill 21. The first will be July 30th from 1 - 2 pm (location: Physics Boardroom, RPB 105) and the second TBD in September. The session will run through an overview of Bill 21 logistics while focusing on providing a space to discuss personal issues surrounding this legislation. Anyone who feels impacted in any way may attend by emailing taliam@physics.mcgill.ca. This is designed to be an informal space for discussion as opposed to, say, a legal briefing. The July 30th session is not exclusively for MGAPS members: undergrads, staff, and faculty are welcome.</p>
<p>Please find the event poster <a href="../files/Bill21sessionposter.pdf">here</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/904040816603499/">Facebook event here</a></p>
<p>In addition, experience tells us that discriminatory legislature can lead to increases in hate crimes. We would also like to support you in accessing help, should you ever need it.</p>

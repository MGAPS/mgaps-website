#### McGill Physics Hackathon 2019

From November 2nd-3rd, the McGill Physics Hackathon will be occurring at MILA - the Quebec AI Institute! Register on the [website](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/) and follow the event on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/McGillPhysicsHackathon/)!

This year, the Hackathon will welcome projects from everyone (and we hope to see more students ranging from secondary one to postsecondary level). In addition to the use of computing, participants will also have access to the use Arduino and Raspberry Pi units should they wish to integrate and enhance their creation with microelectronics. (Note: Projects with and without such integration, will be judged separately, as will projects from different grade levels.)

This year's Hackathon will be AI themed, with a special prize awarded to the team that best integrates AI into their project.

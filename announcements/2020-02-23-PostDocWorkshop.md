#### Postdoctoral Fellowships Workshop

Which postdoctoral fellowships exist in Canada and Europe?
When do you have to apply? When do you have to contact professors?
How do you apply?
What are the requirements for the postdoctoral fellowships?
How do you write a successful research proposal for a fellowship or scholarship?

Do not worry! We will answer these questions for you in a single workshop
Five postdoctoral fellows (Banting, PBEEE, etc.) will speak about their experience to apply for postdoctoral fellowships. They will share unique insights in the application process and provide you with invaluable advice to write a successful application (not only for postdoctoral fellowship but also for graduate scholarships).
The workshop will be held on March 10th from 6 pm â€“ 9 pm at Burnside 1B45.
(Snacks will be provided after the workshop).

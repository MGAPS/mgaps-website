#### Tea and cookies with well being

 Next Thursday 27th February at 5pm in the boardroom, we'll have the first session of our very own support group with special participation of the Science Local Wellness Advisor.
Bring your questions about wellness, mental health and coping strategies for dealing with the stress of grad school, but also feel free to just come for the free food, tea/coffee and procrastination. As always, arts supplies provided for that special relaxing time.
BYO mug/playlist/whatever you want!

See you there!
